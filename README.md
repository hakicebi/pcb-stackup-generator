# PCB Stackup Generator

A web-based tool for generating and visualizing PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layer stackups.

## Features

- Generate stackup visualizations for 2-12 layer PCBs
- Configure board thickness and copper weight
- Real-time preview of the layer stack
- Detailed breakdown of layer dimensions
- Aspect ratio calculation for manufacturability assessment

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Configure your desired stackup parameters:
   - Number of Layers: Select between 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 layers
   - Board Thickness: Set the total board thickness in millimeters
   - Copper Weight: Select copper thickness in ounces (0.5oz, 1oz, 2oz, 3oz)
3. Click "Generate Stackup" to update the preview
4. View the layer visualization and detailed specifications
